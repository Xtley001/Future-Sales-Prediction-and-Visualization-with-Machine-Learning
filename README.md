# Future Sales Prediction and Visualization with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict future sales and provide interactive visualizations using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to deliver accurate sales forecasts and insightful visual analytics.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess raw sales data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models for sales prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Visualization**: Interactive visualizations to explore sales trends and predictions.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place your sales data in the `data/` directory.
2. **Run Preprocessing**: Execute `preprocess.py` to clean and prepare the data.
3. **Train Models**: Use `train_model.py` to train and evaluate the models.
4. **Generate Visualizations**: Run `visualize.py` to create interactive visualizations.
